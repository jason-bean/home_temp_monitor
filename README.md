Basic web page used to read my private MongoDB database to show temperatures on a graph using the CanvasJS charting tools.

Uses Node.js Express as static web server & service. 

Uses Bootstrap for desktop & mobile support. Bootstrap customized so that iPhone 6 landscape is considered a small screen. 

Temperature data is collected from a Raspberry Pi with a Dallas DS18B20 sensor.

Future updates are to include adding an external temperature sensor to the Raspberry Pi.
